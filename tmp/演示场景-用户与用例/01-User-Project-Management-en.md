# User & Project Management — Create Users, Assign Projects, Create Test Cases

Demonstrates the complete user management and project permission workflow: Admin creates a regular user → assigns the user to a project → user logs in and enters the project → creates test cases.

Modules involved: User Management, Project Management (Members), Test Case Management

__Demo duration__: ~5 minutes

## Scenario Overview

The testBench test management platform supports multi-user, multi-project permission management. Administrators can create users and assign them to specific projects. Regular users can only see projects they've been assigned to after logging in, and can create and manage test cases within those projects.

This scenario demonstrates the complete workflow from creating a user to the user independently using the system.

## Prerequisites

Log in as System Administrator (admin / admin123)
At least one project must already exist

> **Note:** Usernames, project names, etc. in this document are example values. If you encounter a "name already exists" error, simply replace with any name that doesn't exist in the system.

## Steps

### Step 1: Administrator Login

1. Open the system URL, navigate to the login page
2. Enter admin credentials: admin / admin123
3. Click [Login]
